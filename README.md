### Hi there 👋, I'm Isaac Almanza


🌱 I’m currently focused on creating smart contract development with solidity.🪐

🔭 I recently worked as a Software Engineer at Fondeadora, a neo-bank in Mexico.  I have built several fintech products in YC startups.

💪 I’m looking to collaborate with like-minded professionals passionate about fintech and the potential of web3 technologies. Whether working on crazy ideas, contributing to disruptive ideas, or exploring new avenues in the financial industry, I am excited to collaborate and make a meaningful impact.

I'm here to help the world build products that change people's lives and teach others things.
