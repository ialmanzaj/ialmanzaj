### Hi there 👋, I'm Isaac Almanza


🌱 I’m currently focused on creating smart contract development with solidity.🪐

🔭 I was recently  working as a Software Engineer at Fondeadora, a neo-bank in Mexico.  I have built several fintech products in YC startups.

💪 I’m looking to collaborate with like-minded professionals who are passionate about fintech and the potential of web3 technologies. Whether it's working on crazy ideas, contributing to disruptive ideas, or exploring new avenues in the financial industry, I am excited to collaborate and make a meaningful impact.

I'm here to help the world build products that change people's life, and teach others things.
